# Generate Plots With Existing Data

For each plot cd to the directory and run the following command. For example to generate 01-LLC_Hit_Time-vs-CPU_Core graph which is the Figure 1 of the paper, you need to run the following code - 
```
cd 01-LLC_Hit_Time-vs-CPU_Core;
python3 plot_knl_data.py;
```
This assumes that the appropriate data files, for example, in this case `knl_data.csv` is present in the folder. This repository contains all the existing data that was used to create the graphs in the paper.
